                        Hi! Iâ€™m Shahriar Nabi Newaz, a wedding & portrait photographer. <br /> I would like to give you a unique photography experience, <br /> built to serve you best and capture your special moments <br /> for you and your families creatively and beautifully.
                    </p>

                    <br />
                    <p>
                        I am not the wedding photographer for couples looking for a fairy tale. I am not the wedding photographer for couples looking for a light and airy dreamscape or a day that feels like a photo shoot. I'm the wedding photographer for you if you value moments and the beauty of your everyday life.
                    </p>
